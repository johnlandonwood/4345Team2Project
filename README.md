# 4345 Team 2 Project - Scientist Social Network Profile Page
Spring 2022 semester project repository for Team 2 - Maria Harrison, Amayrani Luna, Blake Miller, Landon Wood. 

**Introduction**

For this semester project, our class was tasked with creating a sort of social network for scientists – think of LinkedIn or Twitter but targeted for those in academia. We defined 12 functionalities that we wanted our platform to allow at the start of the semester: 

 - Search information, e.g., which papers to read, who are experts in a topic, what’s the trend for a direction, who to follow, etc.
 - Find collaborators for a research project
 - Promote one’s paper publication in the society
 - Form a virtual team to collaborate
 - Follow a researcher; manage followers; tweet/retweet
 - Follow a paper or study
 - Ask a question and hope to receive discussions and answers
 - Find someone to help with payment (freelancer style, e.g. publish a job) 
 - Build up personal profiles, including research interests, credentials,  publications, projects, etc.
- Collaboratively design a data analytics experiment
- Community users can comment on a paper published
- Community users can link studies together to provide peer review.

Each team in our class selected a function that they wanted to work towards implementing. Our team, team 2, chose to work on the function “Build up personal profiles, including research interests, credentials, publications, projects, etc.” We worked on making a **profile page** throughout the semester.

**Download/Installation Instructions**

- Install the `.zip` from this repository (https://github.com/johnlandonwood/4345Team2Project).
- Extract the contents to your chosen location.
- Open the frontend and backend projects in separate windows. To do so, find the `build.sbt` file and open it. IntelliJ should prompt you to “open as project;” choose that option for both frontend and backend.
